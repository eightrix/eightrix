- 👋 Hi, I’m @eightrix, a senior software engineer, full stack developer, product designer and teacher passionate about building both the aesthetic and functional components of web apps and software systems.
- 👀 I’m interested in product design and full stack software development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python/Django and the MERN stack
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source, proprietary and community-based projects
- 📫 How to reach me: @eightrix here and @the8rix on X
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I play the piano, guitar, and drums [doesn't that make me a one-person band?!] and I love dogs, especially one particular unique breed: the Rottweiler!
